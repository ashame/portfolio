This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
Lint errors will be displayed in the console window.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
Correctly bundles `React` in production mode and optimizes the build for better performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once the `eject` command is initialized, it cannot be reverted. **

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from the project.
 
The command will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into the project providing the administrator full control. All commands except `eject` can be initiated, but they will point to the copied scripts and are tweakable.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
